          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            I am a recent graduate with a Masterâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence. With a solid theoretical foundation, my experience spans from working on data science projects to collaborating on 
            conversational agents and recommender systems, to teaching.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            I have a deep interest in mental health, psychology, and nutrition, and throughout my studies, including my exchange in Berlin, I 
            took psychology and neuroscience courses that broadened my understanding of the mind and behaviour. 
            I enjoy exploring how technology, especially AI, can intersect with mental health, well-being and can aid in creativity.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            I love working on creative and impactful projects, always looking to apply my skills to meaningful challenges. I am a quick learner and love the process of learning and growing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In my free time, I enjoy organizing storytelling events, bouldering, and working on personal creative 
            projects like sewing, painting, and experimenting with fashion and creative makeup.
